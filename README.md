# Multiclass_FYP
Final year project.
Using a neural net, determine if an image is correctly exposed, underexposed, or overexposed.

The image is then edited and passed back into the neural net until the neural net is satisfied the exposure is now correct.

H5 file and dataset too large for Github - > must host them elsewhere later.
